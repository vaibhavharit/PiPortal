# PiPortal
Cloud Server Provisioning Portal: a secured portal for Pi DataCenters' departments- Bid data, Finance, PMO and Operations. Includes unique login-id and password sign-in for each department and fields for storing and retrieving data in the database as requested by a client and forwarding it to the next department, along with an auto generated email system to show the details.

NOTE: 
An open-source (free) cross-platform web server stack package is required to run the portal on a localhost. MAMP(MacOS) or XAMPP(Windows) software can be used for this project. Include the project in "htdocs" folder of the localhost application. 

phpMyAdmin (MySQL tool) is used for viewing and editing the database, to be run along with the localhost server application.
